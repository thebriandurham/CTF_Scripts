# CTF_Scripts
Scripts made for various CTF Challenges

## username_enum.py
Got tired of BurpSuite's rate limiting on base version and Hydra's messy cmdline. Quick script to check for a given dork in HTML response from a login form to enumerate a valid username on the server.

## password_enum.py
Same use as username_enum.py, but used to guess the password once a valid username is found
